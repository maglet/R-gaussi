In this lesson, we'll learn about working with data frames using the gapminder 
dataset in your R project folder:

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
```

Let's investigate gapminder a bit; the first thing we should always do is check
out what the data looks like with `str`:

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

We can also examine individual columns of the data frame with our `typeof` function:

```{r}
typeof(gapminder$year)
typeof(gapminder$country)
str(gapminder$country)
```

We can also interrogate the data frame for information about its dimensions;
remembering that `str(gapminder)` said there were 1704 observations of 6
variables in gapminder, what do you think the following will produce, and why?

```{r}
length(gapminder)
```

A fair guess would have been to say that the length of a data frame would be the
number of rows it has (1704), but this is not the case; remember, a data frame
is a *list of vectors and factors*:

```{r}
typeof(gapminder)
```

When `length` gave us 6, it's because gapminder is built out of a list of 6
columns. To get the number of rows and columns in our dataset, try:

```{r}
nrow(gapminder)
ncol(gapminder)
```

Or, both at once:

```{r}
dim(gapminder)
```

We'll also likely want to know what the titles of all the columns are, so we can
ask for them later:

```{r}
colnames(gapminder)
```

At this stage, it's important to ask ourselves if the structure R is reporting
matches our intuition or expectations; do the basic data types reported for each
column make sense? If not, we need to sort any problems out now before they turn
into bad surprises down the road, using what we've learned about how R
interprets data, and the importance of *strict consistency* in how we record our
data.

Once we're happy that the data types and structures seem reasonable, it's time
to start digging into our data proper. Check out the first few lines:

```{r}
head(gapminder)
```

To make sure our analysis is reproducible, we should put the code
into a script file so we can come back to it later.

R has many powerful subset operators and mastering them will allow you to
easily perform complex operations on any kind of dataset.

There are six different ways we can subset any kind of object, and three
different subsetting operators for the different data structures.


## Accessing elements using their indices
```{r}
x[3]
```
We can ask for multiple elements at once:

```{r}
x[c(1, 3)]
```

Or slices of the vector:

```{r}
x[1:4]
```

the `:` operator creates a sequence of numbers from the left element to the right.
```{r}
1:4
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

If we ask for a number outside of the vector, R will return missing values:

```{r}
x[6]
```



## Skipping and removing elements

If we use a negative number as the index of a vector, R will return
every element *except* for the one specified:

```{r}
x[-2]
```


We can skip multiple elements:

```{r}
x[c(-1, -5)]  # or x[-c(1,5)]
```

{: .callout}


To remove elements from a vector, we need to assign the results back
into the variable:

```{r}
x <- x[-4]
x
```


## Subsetting by name

We can extract elements by using their name, instead of index:

```{r}
x[c("a", "c")]
```

This is usually a much more reliable way to subset objects: the
position of various elements can often change when chaining together
subsetting operations, but the names will always remain the same!

Unfortunately we can't skip or remove elements so easily.

To skip (or remove) a single named element:

```{r}
x[-which(names(x) == "a")]
```

The `which` function returns the indices of all `TRUE` elements of its argument.
Remember that expressions evaluate before being passed to functions. Let's break
this down so that its clearer what's happening.

First this happens:

```{r}
names(x) == "a"
```

The condition operator is applied to every name of the vector `x`. Only the
first name is "a" so that element is TRUE.

`which` then converts this to an index:

```{r}
which(names(x) == "a")
```



Only the first element is `TRUE`, so `which` returns 1. Now that we have indices
the skipping works because we have a negative index!

Skipping multiple named indices is similar, but uses a different comparison
operator:

```{r}
x[-which(names(x) %in% c("a", "c"))]
```

The `%in%` goes through each element of its left argument, in this case the
names of `x`, and asks, "Does this element occur in the second argument?".

So why can't we use `==` like before? That's an excellent question.

Let's take a look at the comparison component of this code:

```{r}
names(x) == c('a', 'c')
```

Obviously "c" is in the names of `x`, so why didn't this work? `==`
works slightly differently than `%in%`. It will compare each element
of its left argument to the corresponding element of its right
argument. What happens when you compare vectors of different lengths?

![Equality testing](../fig/rmd-06-equality.1.png)

When one vector is shorter than the other, it gets *recycled*:

![Equality testing](../fig/rmd-06-equality.2.png)

In this case R simply repeats `c("a", "c")` twice. Since the recycled "a"
matches x again we got the output: TRUE FALSE TRUE

If the longer vector length isn't a multiple of the shorter vector 
length, then R will also print out a warning message.

```{r}
names(x) == c('a', 'c', 'e')
```

This difference between `==` and `%in%` is important to remember,
because it can introduce hard to find and subtle bugs!

## Subsetting through other logical operations

We can also more simply subset through logical operations:

```{r}
x[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
```

Note that in this case, the logical vector is also recycled to the
length of the vector we're subsetting!

```{r}
x[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
```

Since comparison operators evaluate to logical vectors, we can also
use them to succinctly subset vectors:

```{r}
x[x > 7]
```

> There are many situations in which you will wish to combine multiple logical
> criteria. For example, we might want to find all the countries that are
> located in Asia **or** Europe **and** have life expectancies within a certain
> range. Several operations for combining logical vectors exist in R:
>
>  * `&`, the "logical AND" operator: returns `TRUE` if both the left and right
>    are `TRUE`.
>  * `|`, the "logical OR" operator: returns `TRUE`, if either the left or right
>    (or both) are `TRUE`.
>
> The recycling rule applies with both of these, so `TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`
> will compare the first `TRUE` on the left of the `&` sign with each of the
> three conditions on the right.
>
> You may sometimes see `&&` and `||` instead of `&` and `|`. These operators
> do not use the recycling rule: they only look at the first element of each
> vector and ignore the remaining elements. The longer operators are mainly used
> in programming, rather than data analysis.
>
>  * `!`, the "logical NOT" operator: converts `TRUE` to `FALSE` and `FALSE` to
>    `TRUE`. It can negate a single logical condition (eg `!TRUE` becomes
>    `FALSE`), or a whole vector of conditions(eg `!c(TRUE, FALSE)` becomes
>    `c(FALSE, TRUE)`).
>
> Additionally, you can compare the elements within a single vector using the
> `all` function (which returns `TRUE` if every element of the vector is `TRUE`)
> and the `any` function (which returns `TRUE` if one or more elements of the
> vector are `TRUE`).

## Handling special values

At some point you will encounter functions in R which cannot handle missing, infinite,
or undefined data.

There are a number of special functions you can use to filter out this data:

 * `is.na` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   containing `NA`.
 * likewise, `is.nan`, and `is.infinite` will do the same for `NaN` and `Inf`.
 * `is.finite` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   that do not contain `NA`, `NaN` or `Inf`.
 * `na.omit` will filter out all missing values from a vector

## Factor subsetting

Now that we've explored the different ways to subset vectors, how
do we subset the other data structures?

Factor subsetting works the same way as vector subsetting.

```{r}
f <- factor(c("a", "a", "b", "c", "c", "d"))
f[f == "a"]
f[f %in% c("b", "c")]
f[1:3]
```

An important note is that skipping elements will not remove the level
even if no more of that category exists in the factor:

```{r}
f[-3]
```

## Data frames

Remember the data frames are lists underneath the hood, so similar rules
apply. However they are also two dimensional objects:

`[` with one argument will act the same was as for lists, where each list
element corresponds to a column. The resulting object will be a data frame:

```{r}
head(gapminder[3])
```

Similarly, `[[` will act to extract *a single column*:

```{r}
head(gapminder[["lifeExp"]])
```

And `$` provides a convenient shorthand to extract columns by name:

```{r}
head(gapminder$year)
```

With two arguments, `[` behaves the same way as for matrices:

```{r}
gapminder[1:3,]
```

If we subset a single row, the result will be a data frame (because
the elements are mixed types):

```{r}
gapminder[3,]
```

But for a single column the result will be a vector (this can
be changed with the third argument, `drop = FALSE`).
