In this lesson, we'll learn about working with data frames using the gapminder 
dataset in your R project folder:


~~~
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
~~~
{: .r}

Let's investigate gapminder a bit; the first thing we should always do is check
out what the data looks like with `str`:


~~~
str(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
'data.frame':	1704 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ year     : int  1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
 $ pop      : num  8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 ...
 $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
 $ lifeExp  : num  28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...
 $ gdpPercap: num  779 821 853 836 740 ...
~~~
{: .output}

We can also examine individual columns of the data frame with our `typeof` function:


~~~
typeof(gapminder$year)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
typeof(gapminder$country)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
str(gapminder$country)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
 Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
~~~
{: .output}

We can also interrogate the data frame for information about its dimensions;
remembering that `str(gapminder)` said there were 1704 observations of 6
variables in gapminder, what do you think the following will produce, and why?


~~~
length(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 6
~~~
{: .output}

A fair guess would have been to say that the length of a data frame would be the
number of rows it has (1704), but this is not the case; remember, a data frame
is a *list of vectors and factors*:


~~~
typeof(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "list"
~~~
{: .output}

When `length` gave us 6, it's because gapminder is built out of a list of 6
columns. To get the number of rows and columns in our dataset, try:


~~~
nrow(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1704
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
ncol(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 6
~~~
{: .output}

Or, both at once:


~~~
dim(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1704    6
~~~
{: .output}

We'll also likely want to know what the titles of all the columns are, so we can
ask for them later:


~~~
colnames(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "country"   "year"      "pop"       "continent" "lifeExp"   "gdpPercap"
~~~
{: .output}

At this stage, it's important to ask ourselves if the structure R is reporting
matches our intuition or expectations; do the basic data types reported for each
column make sense? If not, we need to sort any problems out now before they turn
into bad surprises down the road, using what we've learned about how R
interprets data, and the importance of *strict consistency* in how we record our
data.

Once we're happy that the data types and structures seem reasonable, it's time
to start digging into our data proper. Check out the first few lines:


~~~
head(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
1 Afghanistan 1952  8425333      Asia  28.801  779.4453
2 Afghanistan 1957  9240934      Asia  30.332  820.8530
3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007
4 Afghanistan 1967 11537966      Asia  34.020  836.1971
5 Afghanistan 1972 13079460      Asia  36.088  739.9811
6 Afghanistan 1977 14880372      Asia  38.438  786.1134
~~~
{: .output}

To make sure our analysis is reproducible, we should put the code
into a script file so we can come back to it later.

> ## Challenge
>
> Read the output of `str(gapminder)` again;
> this time, use what you've learned about factors, lists and vectors,
> as well as the output of functions like `colnames` and `dim`
> to explain what everything that `str` prints out for gapminder means.
> If there are any parts you can't interpret, discuss with your neighbors!
>
> > ## Solution to Challenge
> >
> > The object `gapminder` is a data frame with columns
> > - `country` and `continent` are factors.
> > - `year` is an integer vector.
> > - `pop`, `lifeExp`, and `gdpPercap` are numeric vectors.
